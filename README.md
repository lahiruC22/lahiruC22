### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a student at the University of Sri Jayawardenepura, Sri Lanka. Iâ€™m currently in my second year of studying computer science and mathematics. Iâ€™m fascinated by the applications of these fields in various domains such as artificial intelligence, data science, cyber security and more. Iâ€™m eager to learn new skills and technologies and explore new possibilities.

Some of the projects Iâ€™m working on or planning to work on are:
- crypto-trading-algorithm : creating a trading algorithm based on a course lab.
- java-data-structures : a repository contains implementation and use cases of the well known data structures
- to-do-lis-manager : simple to do list manager application with REST API using flutter and spring boot technology.
- AssestsManagementSystem : contribution for the asset management system project in the university.

Some of the skills and tools I use or want to learn are:

- Programming languages: Python, C++, R, MATLAB, Java, C, Flutter, javascript
- Web frameworks: Flask, Bootstrap, jQuery
- Data science libraries: NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, SymPy
- Machine learning frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch
- Cloud platforms: AWS, Google Cloud
- Version control: Git, GitHub

Iâ€™m always open to new opportunities and collaborations. You can reach me at:
